# Transcript Migration Plan

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. New Transcript Model Created
- Created `server/models/Transcript.js` with proper schema
- Includes fields: studentId, filePath, originalName, admissionNo, uploadedBy, fileSize, mimeType
- Added indexes for better query performance

### 2. New Transcript Routes Created
- Created `server/routes/transcripts.js` with comprehensive API endpoints:
  - GET `/transcripts/student/:studentId` - Get transcripts by student
  - GET `/transcripts/admission/:admissionNo` - Get transcripts by admission number
  - GET `/transcripts/download/:transcriptId` - Download transcript file
  - GET `/transcripts/:id` - Get transcript by ID
  - DELETE `/transcripts/:id` - Delete transcript (admin only)

### 3. Server Configuration Updated
- Added transcripts routes to `server/server.js`

### 4. Student Model Updated
- Removed embedded transcripts array from `server/models/Student.js`
- Now uses separate Transcript collection for better scalability

### 5. API Service Updated
- Updated `src/services/api.ts`:
  - Modified `downloadTranscript` method to use new endpoint
  - Added `transcriptsAPI` with methods for transcript management

### 6. Upload Functionality Updated
- Updated `server/routes/students.js` upload functions to create Transcript documents instead of embedding

### 7. Migration Script Created
- Created `server/scripts/migrateTranscripts.js` to migrate existing transcripts from Student model to Transcript collection

### 8. Test Script Created
- Created `server/scripts/testDownload.js` to verify download functionality

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

### 1. Run Migration Script
```bash
cd server
node scripts/migrateTranscripts.js
```

### 2. Test Download Functionality
```bash
cd server
node scripts/testDownload.js
```

### 3. Update Frontend Components
- Update `TranscriptPDFDownload.tsx` to use the new API methods
- Update any other components that reference student.transcripts

### 4. Test Full Workflow
- Upload a new transcript
- Verify it appears in the Transcript collection
- Test download functionality through the UI
- Test access control (student can only see their own transcripts)

### 5. Clean Up
- Remove any old debug/test files
- Verify all functionality works as expected

## ðŸ“‹ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Migration script runs successfully
- [ ] Existing transcripts are migrated correctly
- [ ] New transcript uploads work
- [ ] Transcript download works
- [ ] Access control works (students can only access their own transcripts)
- [ ] Admin can delete transcripts
- [ ] All API endpoints return proper responses

## ðŸš¨ Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **File Path Issues**: Ensure file paths are correctly stored and accessible
2. **Permission Issues**: Check file permissions in uploads directory
3. **Database Consistency**: Verify all references between Student and Transcript collections
4. **Error Handling**: Ensure proper error messages for all scenarios
5. **Performance**: Test with large numbers of transcripts
