# Admin Capabilities Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Add POST endpoint to server/routes/users.js for creating users
- [x] Add create, update, delete methods to studentsAPI in src/services/api.ts
- [x] Update StudentManagement.tsx to make add, edit, delete functional
- [x] Connect AddStudentForm to API for creating new students
- [x] Add edit functionality for students
- [x] Add delete functionality for students
- [x] Import usersAPI in StudentManagement component

## Summary
Admin users can now:
- **Users Management**: Add, edit, and delete users (already working)
- **Students Management**: Add new students (creates user + student record), edit student details, delete students

## Technical Details
- User creation: Creates user account first, then links to student record
- Student editing: Only allows editing admission number, department, and year (not user details)
- Student deletion: Soft delete (deactivates student record)
- Default password for new students: 'defaultPassword123' (should be changed by user)

## Next Steps
- Test the functionality in the application
- Consider adding password reset functionality for new students
- Add validation for unique admission numbers
- Consider adding bulk import functionality for students
