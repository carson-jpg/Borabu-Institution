# User Management Functionality - COMPLETED

## Summary:
The user management functionality has been successfully implemented for the admin dashboard.

## What Was Done:
1. **Created UserManagement Component** (`src/components/Users/UserManagement.tsx`)
   - Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
   - Table view of all users with status indicators
   - Modal forms for adding and editing users
   - Delete confirmation dialogs
   - Integration with existing users API

2. **Updated MainApp.tsx** 
   - Integrated the UserManagement component into the application
   - Replaced the placeholder text with actual functionality

## Files Created/Modified:
- `src/components/Users/UserManagement.tsx` - New user management component
- `src/components/MainApp.tsx` - Updated to use the new UserManagement component

## Features Implemented:
- ✅ View all users in a clean table interface
- ✅ Add new users with name, email, and role
- ✅ Edit existing user information
- ✅ Delete users with confirmation
- ✅ Responsive modal forms
- ✅ Error handling for API calls
- ✅ Loading states

## API Integration:
The component uses the existing `usersAPI` methods:
- `getAll()` - Fetch all users
- `create()` - Create new user
- `update()` - Update existing user
- `delete()` - Delete user

## Current State:
The user management functionality is now fully operational. Users can perform all CRUD operations on users through the new interface, replacing the previous placeholder text.
