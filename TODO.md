# Fix "Failed to fetch fee data" Error

## Problem
- Students see "Failed to fetch fee data" when clicking on Fees in the dashboard
- Issue: FeeManagement.tsx passes `user.id` (User._id) to fees APIs, but backend expects Student._id

## Solution
- [x] Modify FeeManagement.tsx to fetch student data first for students
- [x] Use student._id instead of user.id for fees API calls
- [x] Add proper error handling

## Steps
1. [x] Update fetchFeeRecords function in FeeManagement.tsx
2. [x] For students: fetch student data using studentsAPI.getByUserId(user.id)
3. [x] Use studentData._id for feesAPI.getSummary() and feesAPI.getAll()
4. [x] Test the fix
