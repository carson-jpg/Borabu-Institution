# Teacher Model and Seeder Implementation

## Completed Tasks:
- ✅ Created `server/models/Teacher.ts` - TypeScript Teacher model with proper interface and schema
- ✅ Created `server/models/Department.ts` - TypeScript Department model for compatibility
- ✅ Created `server/scripts/insertTeachers.ts` - TypeScript seeder script for inserting teachers

## Next Steps:
1. **Run the seeder script** to insert teachers into the database
2. **Update server configuration** to support TypeScript compilation if needed
3. **Test the Teacher model** integration with existing routes

## How to Run the Seeder:
Since the backend is currently configured for JavaScript, you may need to:
1. Install TypeScript for the server: `npm install -D typescript @types/node ts-node`
2. Add a tsconfig.json for the server
3. Update package.json scripts to compile and run TypeScript files

Alternatively, you can compile the TypeScript files to JavaScript and run them:
```bash
npx tsc server/scripts/insertTeachers.ts --outDir server/scripts/dist
node server/scripts/dist/insertTeachers.js
```

## Files Created:
- `server/models/Teacher.ts` - Teacher model with TypeScript interface
- `server/models/Department.ts` - Department model with TypeScript interface  
- `server/scripts/insertTeachers.ts` - Seeder script for inserting teacher data
