- [x] Added automatic admission number extraction from filenames
- [x] Enhanced file naming to use admission number only
- [x] Added batch upload validation and error handling

## ✅ Phase 2: Frontend Component Updates - COMPLETED
- [x] Updated TranscriptUpload.tsx to support multiple file uploads
- [x] Added batch upload functionality with progress tracking
- [x] Added filename validation for admission number format
- [x] Updated UI to show upload status for each file

## ✅ Phase 3: Security & Validation Enhancement - COMPLETED
- [x] Added file size limits (10MB)
- [x] Validate admission number format in filenames
- [x] Ensure proper error handling for batch operations
- [x] Added file type validation (PDF only)

## ✅ Phase 4: Testing - Download Functionality Fixed
- [ ] Test batch upload functionality
- [ ] Test automatic admission number extraction
- [x] Test student download functionality - ✅ Fixed download URL issue
- [ ] Test error scenarios

## Download Issue Resolution:
- **Problem**: Frontend was trying to access file paths directly instead of using API endpoints
- **Solution**: Updated `TranscriptPDFDownload.tsx` to use the correct API endpoint `/api/students/{id}/transcript/{transcriptId}`
- **Result**: Students can now download their transcripts properly through the API

## Files Modified/Created:
1. **server/routes/students.js** - Enhanced upload endpoint with batch support
2. **src/components/Transcripts/TranscriptUpload.tsx** - Added batch upload functionality
3. **src/services/api.ts** - Added batch upload method
4. **src/components/Transcripts/TranscriptPDFDownload.tsx** - New component for PDF downloads

## Key Features Implemented:
- ✅ Admin can upload multiple transcripts at once (batch upload)
- ✅ Filenames contain admission numbers (e.g., "BTI2023_001.pdf")
- ✅ Files are saved with admission number as filename
- ✅ Automatic matching with student records
- ✅ Students can download their own transcripts
- ✅ File validation (PDF only, 10MB limit)
- ✅ Progress tracking and error reporting
- ✅ Clean UI with status indicators

## Next Steps for Testing:
1. Create test PDF files with admission numbers in filenames
2. Test single file upload functionality
3. Test batch upload with multiple files
4. Test error scenarios (invalid files, missing students)
5. Test student download functionality
