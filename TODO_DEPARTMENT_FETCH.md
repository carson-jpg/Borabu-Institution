# Department Fetch Implementation Plan

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Analyze current AdminDashboard component
- [x] Check API service for departments endpoint
- [x] Verify backend departments route functionality
- [ ] Update AdminDashboard to fetch and display departments
- [ ] Test the implementation

## Files to Modify:
- src/components/Dashboard/AdminDashboard.tsx

## Current Status:
The AdminDashboard already has department fetching functionality implemented in the useEffect hook. It calls `departmentsAPI.getAll()` and stores the data in the `departments` state. The departments are already being displayed in the "Department Overview" section.

## Next Steps:
Need to verify if there's a separate "Department Management" section that shows the placeholder text "Department Management functionality coming soon..." that needs to be updated.
