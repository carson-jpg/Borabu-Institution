# Timetable Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive timetable management system for the school portal with both backend and frontend components.

## Backend Implementation ✅

### 1. Timetable Model (`server/models/Timetable.js`)
- ✅ Created Mongoose schema for timetables
- ✅ Includes fields: departmentId, year, entries, academicYear, isActive, createdBy
- ✅ Entries contain: courseId, teacherId, dayOfWeek, startTime, endTime, room, type, semester
- ✅ Proper validation and indexing

### 2. API Routes (`server/routes/timetables.js`)
- ✅ GET /api/timetables - Get all timetables (Admin only)
- ✅ GET /api/timetables/:departmentId/:year - Get timetable by department and year
- ✅ GET /api/timetables/student/:studentId - Get student's personalized timetable
- ✅ POST /api/timetables - Create new timetable (Admin only)
- ✅ PUT /api/timetables/:id - Update timetable (Admin only)
- ✅ DELETE /api/timetables/:id - Delete timetable (Admin only)
- ✅ Authentication and role-based authorization
- ✅ Conflict detection for room/time overlaps
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation

### 3. Server Integration (`server/server.js`)

- ✅ Route properly registered at `/api/timetables`

## Frontend Implementation ✅

### 4. API Service (`src/services/api.ts`)
- ✅ Added timetablesAPI with all CRUD operations
- ✅ getAll(), getByDepartmentAndYear(), getStudentTimetable(), create(), update(), delete()
- ✅ Proper error handling and authentication headers

### 5. Timetable View Component (`src/components/Timetable/TimetableView.tsx`)
- ✅ Updated to fetch real data from API
- ✅ Transforms API response to component interface
- ✅ Fallback to mock data if API fails
- ✅ Maintains existing UI and functionality
- ✅ Weekly grid layout with time slots
- ✅ Color-coded class types (Lecture, Practical, Tutorial)

### 6. Timetable Management Component (`src/components/Timetable/TimetableManagement.tsx`)
- ✅ Complete CRUD interface for admins
- ✅ Create, edit, delete timetables
- ✅ Dynamic entry management (add/remove classes)
- ✅ Form validation and conflict detection

- ✅ Integration with departments, courses, and teachers APIs

### 7. Admin Dashboard Integration (`src/components/Dashboard/AdminDashboard.tsx`)
- ✅ Added TimetableManagement component to admin dashboard
- ✅ Proper import and section integration
- ✅ Accessible through admin interface

## Sample Data ✅

### 8. Sample Data Script (`server/scripts/insertSampleTimetables.js`)
- ✅ Script to populate sample timetable data
- ✅ Creates timetables for different departments and years
- ✅ Includes various class types and time slots
- ✅ Prevents duplicate insertions
